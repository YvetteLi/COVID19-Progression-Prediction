Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a respiratory illness that can spread from person to
person. The novel coronavirus was first identified during an investigation into an outbreak in
Wuhan, China. As of March 3, 2020, the mortality rate estimated by the World Health
Organization (WHO) is 3.4%. Up to March 12, there were 125,048 confirmed cases
worldwide and 80,981 confirmed cases in China. Given the severity of this epidemic, it is
crucial to estimate the theoretical number of people infected with COVID-19 in a closed
population over time.
SIR model and its variations have been used to predict the progression of a virus. In this
project, we will predict the progression of COVID-19 from deterministic SIR model,
stochastic SIR model and SEIR model and analyze their advantages and disadvantages.
